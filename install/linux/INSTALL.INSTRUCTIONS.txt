        Installing the PixeLINK SDK on your Linux system
        ================================================

0. Ensure you have the correct PixeLINK SDK Variant
---------------------------------------------------
  There are 12 variants of the PixeLINK SDK (for Linux):
    - For the Ubuntu 16.04 Desktop OS:
       o A 64-bit variant that is built for Intelx86 'PCs'.  These systems
         may have an Intel, or an AMD processor.
       o A 64-bit variant that is built for ARMv8 platforms.  The NVidea 
         Jetson-TX1 is an example of such a platform.
       o A 32-bit variant that is built for ARMv7 platforms.  The Odroid XU4 
         is an example of such a platform.
    - For the Ubuntu 18.04 Desktop OS:
       o A 64-bit variant that is built for Intelx86 'PCs'.  These systems
         may have an Intel, or an AMD processor.
       o A 64-bit variant that is built for ARMv8 platforms.  The NVidea 
         Jetson-TX2 is an example of such a platform.
       o A 32-bit variant that is built for ARMv7 platforms.  The Odroid XU4
         is an example of such a platform.
    - For the Ubuntu 20.04 Desktop OS:
       o A 64-bit variant that is built for Intelx86 'PCs'.  These systems
         may have an Intel, or an AMD processor.
       o A 64-bit variant that is built for ARMv8 platforms.  The NVidea 
         Jetson-Xavier is an example of such a platform.
    - For the Ubuntu 22.04 Desktop OS:
       o A 64-bit variant that is built for Intelx86 'PCs'.  These systems
         may have an Intel, or an AMD processor.
       o A 64-bit variant that is built for ARMv8 platforms.  The Raspberry
         Pi 4 is an example of such a platform.
    - For the Ubuntu 24.04 Desktop OS:
       o A 64-bit variant that is built for Intelx86 'PCs'.  These systems
         may have an Intel, or an AMD processor.
       o A 64-bit variant that is built for ARMv8 platforms.  The Raspberry
         Pi 5 is an example of such a platform.
   
   If you are a different Debian-based OS on your ARM platform, then item 10
   below may be of assistance in getting the SDK and the cameras to work with
   your system.

1. Install prerequisite libraries
---------------------------------
  The Pixelink API uses the libraries listed below.  Please install the latest
  variant of these libraries on your system.  Be sure to choose the 64-bit 
  variant for PCs and ARMv8s, the 32-bit variant for ARMv7s. 
    - GNU C++ toolchain, including the G++ compiler/linker.  For instance, you
      could use the following command to install the necessary tools to build
      basic applications (including the GNU C++ toolchain):
         sudo apt-get install build-essential
    - If you intend to use the Pixelnk API Python interface, then you will
      need to install Python package installer:
         sudo apt-get install python3-pip
  As explained in the READ.ME.txt file, there are two variants of the Pixelink
  API; the standard (default) version that is fully functional, and a 'Lite'
  version that has reduced dependencies and functionality.  The standard 
  version of the API has the following additional dependencies:
    - SDL2.  Simple Directmedia Layer, used principally for video previewing 
      capabilities.  For instance, you can download the 2.0 version of this
      library with the following command:
         sudo apt-get install libsdl2-2.0
      Additionally, if you intend to develop (Gnome based) GUI applications, 
      similar to the capture OEM sample application, you will need the 
      development files for this library.  That is:
         sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev 
    - GTK+3 and Glade, used for the (Gnome-based) GUI applications 
      captureOEM and simpleGui.  GTK+3 is a dependent library of Glade, so
      installing Glade will also install GTK+3.  Your version of Gnome will
      have software package management tool, it's usually easiest to use it
      to download the Glade tool.  Alternatively, you can use the following
      command to get Glade:
         sudo apt-get install glade

  NOTE:Some of these dependent libraries may not be part of 'official' 
  distribution for your particular install, as they rely on open-source 
  software.  If your system cannot find the above libraries, then you
  can update the search repositories with commands such as:
       sudo add-apt-repository universe
       sudo add-apt-repository multiverse
       sudo apt-get update

2. Install the PixeLINK SDK files
---------------------------------  
  All of the PixeLINK SDK files have been archived into the compressed archive
  file PixelinkSdk-for-zzzzz-vx.y, where 'zzzzz' identifies the target OS for 
  the specific install (such as Ubuntu24.04-PC_64 for a 64-bit build of Ubuntu
  v14.04 on a PC platform), and 'x' and 'y' refer to the version and 
  sub-version respectively.  Before de-compressing this archive, you should 
  consider an 'appropriate' location for the PixeLINK files.  For example, a 
  single user install may want to locate the files off of the directory 
  ~/PixeLINKSdk, whereas a multi-user install would want the files located in a
  more central location.  When decompressed (using a command like tar -xzvf 
  PixelinkSdk-for-Ubuntu18.04-PC_64-v2.0.tar.gz) , the PixeLINK SDK will be 
  expanded into the following folders:
    - lib.  This folder contains the shared libraries required to build (link) 
      camera control applications.  Your build process must be able to 'locate' 
      these libraries (see step 4 below).  The file HOW.TO.USE.PxlApiLite.txt
      contains instructions on how to use the 'Lite' variant of the Pixelink
      API (as explained in the READ.ME.txt file).
    - include.  This folder contains the 'C' header files describing the 
      programmers interface to the PixeLINK API.  
    - samples.  This folder contains a series of other folders which provide 
      sample applications that use the PixeLINK API.  These folders contain all 
      of the source and makefiles needed to build the application.
    - utilities.  This folder contains any PixeLINK utility programs, provided
      in binary form.  See the READ.ME.txt file for a list of these utilities.

3. Create a PIXELINK_SDK_INC and PIXELINK_SDK_LIB environmental variables
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
  These environmental variables identify the folder where the PixeLINK SDK files
  have been installed (from the previous step).  See the makefiles in the sample 
  application to see how this variable can be used to build applications.

  The easiest way to do this, is to create and export them within a startup
  script.  One way of doing this is shown in step 5.

4. Ensure your applications are building for Linux
--------------------------------------------------
  In order to create new Linux applications, you will need to ensure that the
  application uses the Linux system header files.  The PixeLINK API uses the 
  same header files for Linux and Windows.  To ensure PixeLINK API used by
  your new application includes the Linux system header files, as opposed to 
  those used by Windows, define the PIXELINK_LINUX compilation symbol.  See 
  the makefile from the sample applications for an example.

5. Configure your system so that the runtimes can find the PixeLINK shared 
objects
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
  You could do this by locating the shared objects in a common location (such as
  /lib) and using the ldconfig to create the necessary links to the shared 
  libraries, however this requires super user privilege.  Alternatively, you can
  add the path $PIXELINK_SDK_LIB (where PIXELINK_SDK was created in step 3 
  above) to the environmental variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

  For example, assuming the Pixelink SDK files from step 2 were installed to 
  the ~/PixelinkSdk folder, you could accommodate step 3 and 5 by adding the 
  following set of commands to a particular users ~/.bashrc file:
      # +++++ Pixelink cameras/SDK +++++
      PIXELINK_SDK_INC=~/PixelinkSdk/include
      PIXELINK_SDK_LIB=~/PixelinkSdk/lib
      LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$PIXELINK_SDK_LIB
      export PIXELINK_SDK_INC
      export PIXELINK_SDK_LIB
      export LD_LIBRARY_PATH
      # ----- Pixelink cameras/SDK -----

6. Ensure your applications build against the PixeLINK Api
---------------------------------------------------------
  The PixeLINK API is 'packaged' as a single dynamic libraries; PxLApi.
  Be sure to include this libraries when linking your application.  See the 
  sample makefiles for more information.
  
7. If you will be running Python applications, install the Python package
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
  This is done using the pip3 command, as in:
     pip3 install pixelinkWrapper
  See ~/PixeLINKSdk/Python/README.md for more details.

8. Add read/write privilege to the camera device(s) (USB cameras only)
----------------------------------------------------------------------  
  PixeLINK API applications require read and write access to the USB device (the
  camera) in order to communicate with the device.  On Ubuntu, this can be 
  accomplished by creating a 'PixeLINK.rules' file in the '/etc/udev/rules.d'
  folder, that contains the following lines:
    SUBSYSTEM=="usb",ATTRS{idVendor}=="1996",MODE="0666"
    SUBSYSTEM=="usb_device",ATTRS{idVendor}=="1996",MODE="0666"
  Note that you will need super user privilege to create this file in this 
  folder, but once this is done, all users will be able to control all PixeLINK
  cameras connected to the system.  For instance, the following command will
  open/create this file:
    sudo gedit /etc/udev/rules.d/PixeLINK.rules

9. Increase the amount of receive buffer space available to devices (on newer installs
   this is rarely required).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  9.1 - USB cameras
  -----------------

  By default, the Linux kernel will allocate as little as 16MB of buffer space 
  for all USB devices.  For larger, higher speed devices (such as the PixeLINK 
  USB3 cameras) this is not adequate.  At 400 MB/s, 16MB of buffer space only 
  amounts to 40 ms of buffer time before data loss occurs.  Calling the API
  function PxLSetStreamState to turn on the camera stream, will return a 
  warning return code of ApiSuccessLowMemory if your system is currently
  configured for very little buffer space.  See the sample application
  lowLinkMemory for details.

  To increase the amount of USB buffer space to a more appropriate value 
  (in this case, 1GB), do the following:

  9.1.1 - Systems using GRUB based bootloader (such as Ubuntu running on a PC)
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
     - Edit the file ‘/etc/default/grub’ and look for the line 
       ‘GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=”{some_text}”
     - Append ”usbcore.usbfs_memory_mb=1000” to the end of some_text.  For 
       example:
           GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=”quiet splash” 
       becomes
           GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=”quiet splash usbcore.usbfs_memory_mb=1000”
     - Effect this change with the following command:
           sudo update-grub
     - Manually set the memory limit (to 1GB) by entering the command: 
           ‘sudo modprobe usbcore usbfs_memory_mb=1000’
     - Reboot your system for this change to take effect.

  9.1.2 - Nvidia Jetsons:
          Tk1  (with L4T drivers version 21.1 or newer)
          Tx1  (with L4T drivers version 24.1 or newer)
          Tx2  (with L4T drivers version 28.1 or newer)
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
     The Jetson does not use the GRUB bootloader.  However, it does provide a 
     means to ‘configure’ the USB environment, making it more suitable for a
     high speed USB camera.  In particular, the following file must be edited:
          ‘/boot/extlinux/extlinux.conf’
     In particular, ensure the APPEND definition contains the following two
     entries:
          usb_port_owner_info=2
          usbcore.usbfs_memory_mb=1000
     Note that the usb_port_owner_info entry may already be there, but set to a
     value of 0.  A 0 value will have the USB port operate in USB2 mode, while
     a value of 2 is necessary for USB3 operation. 

     A reboot will be required to effect this change. 
  
  9.1.3 - Raspberry Pi 4 running Raspbian:
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     To ensure the USB host controller has sufficient buffer space to stream at
     high data rates, add the following text near the beginning of the file 
     /boot/cmdline.txt
          usbcore.usbfs_memory_mb=1000

     A reboot will be required to effect this change. 

  9.1.4 - Raspberry Pi 4 running Ubuntu:
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     To ensure the USB host controller has sufficient buffer space to stream at
     high data rates, the /etc/rc.local file needs to be created or modified.
     If this file is not already on your system, you can create it as follows:
        'sudo touch /etc/rc.local'
        'sudo chmod 744 /etc/rc.local'
     The add the folloing lines to the file:
         #!/bin/sh -e
         echo 1000 > /sys/module/usbcore/parameters/usbfs_memory_mb
         exit 0
     
     If this file is already on your system, then add the follwing text near the 
     bottom of the file 
          echo 1000 > /sys/module/usbcore/parameters/usbfs_memory_mb

     A reboot will be required to effect this change. 

  9.1.5 - Other Embedded platforms (such as the Ubuntu running ARM based 
          platforms like the ODROID-XU3 & XU4).
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
     For these systems, the amount of USB buffer space can be via a 
     configuration file that gets loaded at boot time.  Specifically, edit the 
     following file:
          '/media/boot/boot.ini'
     Towards the end of this file, you will see an entry that starts with 
     'setenv bootargs'.  You must add 'usbcore.usbfs_memory_mb=1000' to that 
     line.

     A reboot will be required to effect this change. 

  9.2 - Gigabit Ethernet (including 10 GigE) cameras
  --------------------------------------------------

  9.2.1 - Redefining the IP stack receive buffer space
  -----------------------------------------------------
  By default, the Linux kernel will allocate as little as mere 256 bytes of 
  receive buffer space for it's IP stack.  For larger, higher speed devices 
  (such as the Pixelink 10 GigE cameras) this is not adequate.  Calling the 
  API function PxLSetStreamState to turn on the camera stream, will return a 
  warning return code of ApiSuccessLowMemory if your system is currently
  configured for very little buffer space.  See the sample application
  lowLinkMemory for details.

  Increasing the amount of receive buffer space to a more appropriate value 
  (in this case, 25 MB) is outlined as follows.  It's recommended that you
  allocate enough receive buffer space for at least 2 images.  For instance,
  if you will be using your system to stream a 6 megapixel camera using a 
  16-bit pixel format, then you should have at least 24 MB of receive buffer.

     - Edit the file ‘/etc/sysctl.conf’ (requires super-user privilege)
     - Add the following to the file
           # Allow 25MB of receive buffer memory
           net.core.rmem_max=26214400
           net.core.rmem_default=26214400
     - Effect this change with the following command:
           sudo sysctl -p
           
  9.2.1 - Enabling 'Jumbo' Ethernet frames (packets)
  --------------------------------------------------
  The original Ethernet specification defined the maximum packet size as
  1500 bytes.  This packet size is too small to accommodate newer high 
  capacity / throughout network devices such as Pixelink 10 GigE cameras. 
  Fortunately, most current NICs and switches, can accommodate larger 'jumbo'
  frames.  
  
  To ensure maximum performance from your Pixelink 10 GigE camera, ensure that
  the systems NIC, and all intermediate Ethernet switches between the host 
  system and the camera, have defined the maximum frame size of at least 9000
  bytes.   
  
  Note that the Raspberry Pi 4 platform does not support jumbo frames without
  modifications to its kernel.  See the 'Known Issues' in the READ.ME.txt
  file for more details.  
  

10. Supplemental Information for other installs
----------------------------------------------

  The PixeLINK SDK was designed to work with Ubuntu Desktop OS.  However, we 
  recognize that some customers may prefer to work with some platforms that
  use a Debian-based OS other than Ubuntu.  This is particularly true for the
  varying ARM platforms.  We maintain a variety of different Linux platforms 
  that we use to design and test against.  However, we have a number of 
  customers that are using Pixelink cameras / SDK on other platforms.  Listed
  here is a brief discription of some of those platforms, and perhaps a hint
  or two of some configuration options that may be helpful in your specific
  installation.
  
  Note that in may instances, it may be easier to install/run the 'Lite' 
  variant of the API on these alternate platforms, as it has fewer 
  dependencies.
  
  10.1 - Raspberry Pi 3 running Raspbian
  --------------------------------------
  We have tested our camera with a Raspberry Pi 3 system, running a Raspbian 
  (v1.3) OS.  However, this version of the OS contains some libraries from 
  Ubuntu 14.04, and others from Ubuntu 16.04.  To assist users who are 
  attempting to do similar, we have included copies of some of the open 
  source libraries used by the PixeLINK SDK.  Specifically, the folder 
  'supplementalLibrariesForOtherPlatforms' contains several archive files, 
  each file containing specific libraries that were used to build specific 
  variants of our SDK.  If you have tried running the PixeLINK SDK that most 
  closely matches your distribution, but are having difficulties because of 
  mismatched library versions, then the specific library version you need may 
  be located in one of these archive files.

  For example, for the Raspberry Pi 3 running Raspbian 1.3 (which uses ARMv7 
  binaries), the PixeLINK SDK to use is 
  'PixeLINKSdk-for-Ubuntu14.04-ARMv7-vx.y.tar.gz', together with supplemental 
  libraries in 'SupplementalLibraries-Ubuntu14.04-ARMv7).

  10.2 - QNX
  ----------
  QNX offers a USB3 Vision Driver for their OS.  We have a number of customers
  that are using this driver to control a Pixelink USB3 camera.
  
  10.3 - Arch
  -----------
  Arch does not use GRUB to define the amount of buffer space to allocate to 
  the USB stack(see 9.1 above).  Rather, the below command can be used to 
  ensure the USB stack has sufficient memory:
    sudo sh -c 'echo 1000 > /sys/module/usbcore/parameters/usbfs_memory_mb'
  
11.0 - Specific versions of dependent lbraries
----------------------------------------------
   
  Note that supplemental libraries included are specific to the version required
  by the PixeLINK SDK.  So, for instance, it will include a symbolic link for
  the library libopenjpeg.so.5 (as well as the specific library as well), but it
  does not update the more generic link libopenjpeg.so -- so it's possible to
  have these supplemental variants co-located with the ones that are already 
  installed on this platform.
