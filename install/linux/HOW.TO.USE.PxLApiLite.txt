                   -- How to use PxLApiLite --
                   ===========================

The Pixelink SDK includes two versions of the Pixelink API binary; the fully
featured variant (used by default), and a reduced footprint / reduced 
functionality variant known as PxLApiLite.  This latter variant would be of
interest to smaller run-time Linux environments that have more limited,
resources -- such as an embedded Linux system.

See the READ.ME.txt file for a detailed description of the differences between
the two API variants.

You can use the PxLApiLite variant, by simply deleting the default symbolic
link file that points to the fully featured API variant, and create a new one
that points to the API Lite variant.  That is, similar to:
   rm ($PIXELINK_SDK_LIB)/libPxLApi.so
   ln -s ($PIXELINK_SDK_LIB)/libPxLApiLite.so.a.b.c.d \
         ($PIXELINK_SDK_LIB)/libPxLApi.so  
Where $PIXELINK_SDK_LIB is where the Pixelink SDK library files were 
installed, and 'a.b.c.d' is the version of the Pixelink API installed.
